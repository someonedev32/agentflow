    <h1>About AgentFlow Pro</h1>

    <p>
      AgentFlow Pro is an offline-first iOS app built specifically for real estate agents who need speed,
      reliability, and simplicity while working with clients.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is simple: help real estate agents respond faster, stay organized,
      and look professional — even without an internet connection.
    </p>

    <h2>Why AgentFlow Pro?</h2>
    <p>
      Real estate agents spend most of their time on the move: in cars, at property visits,
      on phone calls, and in areas with poor connectivity.
      AgentFlow Pro keeps all listings stored locally on your iPhone, so you can search, update,
      and share properties instantly.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Focus On</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Offline-first performance</li>
      <li>Fast property search and filtering</li>
      <li>Instant WhatsApp sharing</li>
      <li>Multi-language support</li>
      <li>Clean, agent-focused design</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who It’s For</h2>
    <p>
      AgentFlow Pro is designed for independent agents and small agencies who want a reliable
      personal workspace for their listings — not a public marketplace.
    </p>
